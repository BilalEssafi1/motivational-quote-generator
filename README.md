## Copy Button
A simple "Copy Quote" button allows users to easily copy the quote to share it elsewhere.

## Add to Favorites List
A simple 'Add to Favorites' button lets users save their favorite quotes to a separate list. This list provides additional options for users to copy the quote for sharing or delete it if they no longer wish to keep it. The system ensures no duplicates, meaning each quote can only appear in the favorites list once.
